## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I

This project is my first attempt at familiar myself with github in general along with tailwind. The logic part itself is not really hard but with the appearance of Next.js actually makes things more complicated than it needs to be.

I am fully aware that the use of Next.js in this type of project is overkill and is not needed, but I personally think this is a perfect project for someone who is still lack in experience like me.

### Continued development

- I will attempt to deal with the metadata later.
- I also know that I have messed up the structure of the project, particular in the inputs and options (I should just use a single form element to deal with them in stead of using multiple form elements). Well, that is my fault for being cocky, I should plan ahead the next time no matter how simply a project seems to be.

### Useful resources

- [Rem or Pixels?](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/) - This blog helped me to use the correct units in styling. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [App router?](https://vercel.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-the-next-js-app-router-and-how-to-fix-them) - This is an amazing document which helped me finally understand the common pitfalls when handling with app router. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - if you use tailwind then you will need to know about this docs of course.
